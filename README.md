    The Pacific Hurricane Season 1975 project involves extracting information from a Wikipedia page and converting it into structured data through web scraping techniques. This project focuses on hurricanes that occurred in the Pacific during 1975. The page used for data collection can be found at [1975 Pacific hurricane season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Pacific_hurricane_season). The key attributes gathered include the name of each hurricane, its start and end dates, the number of fatalities, and the areas affected by the storm..
